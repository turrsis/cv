Hello,

My name is Yaroslav Sych.

With 20+ years in software development and leadership experience, I’m strong at operational coordination, clear communication, and keeping execution on track.

In my recent roles, I handled overall coordination: aligning priorities with stakeholders, tracking progress and risks, organizing planning routines, and removing blockers so the team could focus on delivery. My technical background helps me translate business goals into actionable plans and keep quality high.

I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute and answer any questions.

Best regards,
Yaroslav Sych
