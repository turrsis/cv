Hello,

My name is Yaroslav Sych.

I’m a Full-Stack developer (Vue 3 + Node.js) with 20+ years of experience and a strong habit of taking features all the way to production. I have end-to-end SaaS experience: from UI and architecture to APIs, releases, and ongoing support.

My core stack includes Vue 3, Node.js/Express, REST APIs, Docker, and Git. I ramp up quickly, communicate clearly around requirements, and consistently deliver reliable results.

I’d welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute and answer any questions.

Best regards,
Yaroslav Sych
